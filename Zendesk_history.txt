(2023-10-23 12:44:02) Wishart Group: 2 versions available depending on usage. 160 or 320:

@ 25oC (l/hr) 24 or 48
(2023-10-23 12:44:30) Wishart Group: 320 is most common as there is little in the price.

(2023-10-23 12:49:43) Wishart Group: Yes, that'll work. Any wall external tanks for these systems? Wall mounting brackets?
(2023-10-23 12:50:21) Alistair Sharp: No, no additional tanks or wall mountings required, thanks

(2023-09-28 14:38:31) Wishart Group: I've never heard of A811C nor can I find any info online for this particular model.
(2023-09-28 14:39:05) Visitor 27558955: We think thats the serial number as its been etched in and we work for a large construction company called CTS it could be under Serial number 97C081

(2023-09-28 14:40:25) Visitor 27558955: thank you. That is etched onto the back of the machine as well
(2023-09-28 14:45:31) Visitor 27558955: we have an oven with 2 doors but can't find it. it could be AH8C

(2023-09-28 14:56:47) Visitor 27558955: the fan has broken
(2023-09-28 14:59:45) Wishart Group: Let me speak to Genlab. Possibly they could get an engineer to look at it, but Bristol is quite far away from Genlab in Widnes and we're based in Northern Ireland, close to CTS Antrim.
(2023-09-28 15:00:14) Visitor 27558955: Can you please let me know by email
(2023-09-28 15:00:24) Wishart Group: will do.

(2023-03-01 13:05:49) Wishart Group: So, the FLOW-24 you're viewing would be the smallest. What do you require?
(2023-03-01 13:06:04) Visitor 69296042: How much is the smallest Flow-24 model, and would the price include hepa filters and delivery to the UK?
(2023-03-01 13:06:44) Wishart Group: Do you want me to send you a quote?
(2023-03-01 13:07:00) Visitor 69296042: We need a small clean bench/ laminar hood to assemble 6 devices  hence we only need the smallest most compact unit - yes please to the quote

(2023-03-01 13:09:48) Wishart Group: Do you have a bench or need a cart? (this changes lead time)

(2023-02-20 16:36:23) Wishart Group: Yes
(2023-02-20 16:36:30) Wishart Group: Hi, how can we help you today? =)
(2023-02-20 16:36:40) Graham Sheward: I am interested in the P20-BT
(2023-02-20 16:37:09) Graham Sheward: Does this fume hood mean I won't need a scrubber for room
(2023-02-20 16:38:21) Wishart Group: What chemicals/powders are you using?
(2023-02-20 16:38:50) Graham Sheward: hydrochloric Acid, Sulfuric and possibly Nitric Acid.
(2023-02-20 16:39:00) Graham Sheward: Hopefully not Nitric
(2023-02-20 16:39:13) Wishart Group: What quantities?
(2023-02-20 16:39:51) Graham Sheward: Per unit, probably 15 lt a time
(2023-02-20 16:40:18) Wishart Group: Are you boiling or heating it?
(2023-02-20 16:40:28) Graham Sheward: no
(2023-02-20 16:42:19) Wishart Group: At these quantities and without heating it should be OK without a scrubber.
(2023-02-20 16:42:42) Graham Sheward: What is delivery time to Bristol UK
(2023-02-20 16:43:47) Wishart Group: P20 is in stock at Air Science UK. So lead time is approximately 1 week without stand, 2 weeks with stand.
(2023-02-20 16:44:21) Graham Sheward: I am initially looking at 2 units followed by another 4-6
(2023-02-20 16:45:12) Wishart Group: OK 2 units in 1 to 2 weeks. Another 4 to 6 would take about 6 to 8 weeks from USA.
(2023-02-20 16:45:35) Graham Sheward: OK and how long do the filters last.
(2023-02-20 16:46:51) Wishart Group: Depends on usage. Usually 6 months to a year.
(2023-02-20 16:47:22) Wishart Group: With this amount of units you would want to have stock of filters.
(2023-02-20 16:47:36) Graham Sheward: yes thats why I am asking.
(2023-02-20 16:48:04) Graham Sheward: also do you do extractor fans that are imune to rust.
(2023-02-20 16:49:04) Wishart Group: For the P10 or for ductwork?
(2023-02-20 16:49:18) Graham Sheward: Ductwork
(2023-02-20 16:49:23) Wishart Group: We do not do extractor fans for ductwork.
(2023-02-20 16:49:46) Graham Sheward: OK, I will get back to you with order when ready, thanks
(2023-02-20 16:50:10) Wishart Group: OK, do you want a quote in the meantime?

(2021-09-28 13:36:16) Wishart Group: So, balance would be in York?
(2021-09-28 13:36:51) Visitor 67515287: Yes
(2021-09-28 13:37:11) Visitor 67515287: I am looking at the Explorer Precision EX423M
(2021-09-28 13:37:40) Wishart Group: OK, you know the M is an approved balance, do you need an approved balance?
(2021-09-28 13:38:06) Visitor 67515287: i am unsure  what is it approved for
(2021-09-28 13:38:35) Wishart Group: You'll not need it if you don't know what it is.
(2021-09-28 13:38:51) Wishart Group: EX423 is better choice.
(2021-09-28 13:39:18) Visitor 67515287: would i be able to use it to calibrate pipette is not approved
(2021-09-28 13:40:31) Wishart Group: Are these you own pipettes or other companies pipettes?
(2021-09-28 13:41:05) Visitor 67515287: i believe they are Star lab pipettes
(2021-09-28 13:42:16) Wishart Group: I don't think you need approved balances to calibrate pipettes. Maybe UKAS calibration, but not approved. Does your procedures say your balances need to be approved?
(2021-09-28 13:45:11) Visitor 67515287: I am asking my manager about this I may need to get o you about this tomorrow
(2021-09-28 13:45:49) Wishart Group: Approved means the balance is locked and cannot be adjusted and the last digit on the scale is not applicable in readings. You can legally argue the weight of something with an approved scale/balance. It is used if your selling from a scale (gold, veg etc) or Statistical Quality Control SQC.
(2021-09-28 13:45:58) Wishart Group: I doubt you'll need it.
(2021-09-28 13:46:45) Visitor 67515287: I think we dont need it to be approved as we are not selling gold nor are a glp Lab
(2021-09-28 13:47:27) Wishart Group: I think it is best for me to get Northern Balance to quote you. They're in Newcastle and are UKAS accredited, so they can come and do the calibration work. Do you have an email address for me to share with them?
(2021-09-28 13:48:16) Visitor 67515287: william.Feathers@Fera.co.uk
(2021-09-28 13:48:48) Wishart Group: Thanks William I'll share your details with them and this correspondence.
(2021-09-28 13:48:57) Visitor 67515287: thank you
(2021-09-28 13:49:01) Wishart Group: Thanks for chatting with us. Have we resolved your question(s)?

(2021-09-13 15:56:06) Wishart Group: How small? 2.5L, 4L...
(2021-09-13 15:56:36) Mary: 2.5 would be enough
(2021-09-13 15:57:15) Mary: I think that it would need to be cooling to stay at 20C
(2021-09-13 15:57:16) Wishart Group: https://www.wishartgroup.co.uk/temperature_equipment/water_and_oil_baths/nickel-electro_ne1-25
(2021-09-13 15:59:00) Wishart Group: Temperature Range is Ambient + 5°C - 100°C. There is no cooling in them, only through natural cooling against the room temperature.
(2021-09-13 15:59:03) Mary: Can this bath cool to 5C if the ambient temperature is 25
(2021-09-13 15:59:40) Wishart Group: Not this bath. I'll send you different model.
(2021-09-13 15:59:47) Mary: Do you have a small cooling bath as ambient is is more thant 15C

(2021-09-13 16:02:09) Mary: How much is this one please?
(2021-09-13 16:02:26) Wishart Group: The Huber Kiss 12 has Temperature range 	-20...200 °C.
(2021-09-13 16:02:59) Wishart Group: I'd have to get pricing from Huber and send you quote in the morning. Do you have email address?
(2021-09-13 16:04:21) Mary: lab@tatlockandthomson.com
(2021-09-13 16:05:39) Wishart Group: Thanks Mary, BTW it'll be around the £5K mark, so nowhere near the NE1-2.5 price. That OK?
(2021-09-13 16:06:06) Mary: oh no that is a bit more than I expected.
(2021-09-13 16:06:49) Mary: Thank you for your help though
(2021-09-13 16:09:04) Wishart Group: There is only really Huber and Julabo that'll have cooling and heating baths. Both will be around the same price. I'll email you price anyway in the morning, might be less than I think.

Alternatively you can cool NE-1-2.5 by adding ice to the bath.

(2021-07-21 11:17:05) Wishart Group: Here is how it works.
(2021-07-21 11:17:35) Wishart Group: Make sure you get wifi in your cupboard. Fridges/freezers are difficult for signal.
(2021-07-21 11:17:44) Wishart Group: Do you want a quote?
(2021-07-21 11:18:10) Wishart Group: If so, please provide email address.
(2021-07-21 11:19:40) Visitor 31182167: Do you have anything that's not wifi?
(2021-07-21 11:20:32) Wishart Group: https://thermometer.co.uk/data-loggers-with-lcd-display/573-thermadata-logger-td.html
(2021-07-21 11:21:02) Wishart Group: I assume it just the air temperature and you do not want a probe to put into sample or something?
(2021-07-21 11:22:12) Visitor 31182167: Yes just air temp - it's to monitor medicines in cupboards
(2021-07-21 11:23:40) Wishart Group: With the ThermaData you have a USB cradle to download results for analysis.

(2021-07-19 12:25:34) Visitor 91511009: Hello. Do you provide weights for the checkweighers to replicate the actual product weight and the tare weight. For the quantity control checks?
(2021-07-19 12:27:03) Wishart Group: Yes we can provide weights. I'd need to know weight value? Weight Class (F1, F2, M1 etc)? And material (Stainless Steel, Brass or Cast Iron)?

(2021-07-19 12:30:31) Wishart Group: Attached is our weights price list. Discount would apply.
(2021-07-19 12:33:33) Visitor 91511009: Not like a cast iron weight. We currently use rice packs to check the actual weight of the product. so if we have a 250g sausage pack we put a 250g ricepack down the line to replicate the to ensure our checkweigher is working efficiently. And we also have a t2-1g pack to check to If it goes below t2 that it would reject into the reject bin.  Have you somehting which would reflect this.
(2021-07-19 12:36:36) Wishart Group: I'd recommend Weight Set, 500g-1g, OIML M1:

Could you advise me please on pH sensor? I’ve got Mettler Toledo FiveEasy F20 and LE438 sensor with 1.2 m; BNC / Cinch cable. I am looking to buy InLab Micro pH sensor for measuring pH in small vials. There are two options InLab Micro Pro-ISM with MultiPin cable and Electrode pH InLab Micro with S7 cable type. I am not sure which one will fit in my meter. Thank you

(2021-04-23 13:13:43) Visitor 32185162: I need 2 test weights 108g and 65g do these exist please?
(2021-04-23 13:15:14) Wishart Group: Maybe you could get them custom made. Usually, you would get a 100g, 50g, 10g, 5g, 2g and 1g and you would make up the 108g and 65g out of these.
(2021-04-23 13:16:03) Visitor 32185162: is it as simple as them being glued together?
(2021-04-23 13:16:58) Wishart Group: No, definitely not glue will affect the weight. If we're calibrating a scale we just set weights on separately.
(2021-04-23 13:17:04) Wishart Group: What are you doing?
(2021-04-23 13:17:42) Visitor 32185162: im not entirly sure. I'll go ask the boss again
(2021-04-23 13:18:09) Wishart Group: OK. Please email me on peter@wishartgroup.co.uk.

(2021-02-17 15:21:19) Visitor 48407251: I was chatting to you guys the other day, but forgot to note down the direct contact details to request info/quotes.  Could you help me out?  I was asking about the LT15/11 and L15/11 furnaces.
(2021-02-17 15:21:29) Visitor 48407251: I'd add I'm also interested in the Nabertherm NAT 30/85, but you don't seem to stock that one.
(2021-02-17 15:22:50) Wishart Group: Yes, I was speaking with you. We can sell all Nabertherm products.

(2021-02-17 15:16:35) Visitor 78806537: it's about autotitrators

(2021-02-17 15:17:46) Visitor 78806537: if I have a DG111-SC electrode and it isn't being used, should it be stored in a solution or is OK just on the titrator with nothing covering it?
(2021-02-17 15:20:58) Wishart Group: Hi, DG111-SG is the clear probe. It needs to be stored in solution.
(2021-02-17 15:21:16) Wishart Group: Sorry, he got cut off. Bad signal.
(2021-02-17 15:21:44) Visitor 78806537: OK thanks - is his e-mail just david @wishartgroup.com?

(2021-02-16 11:02:45) Visitor 48407251: Hello, I'm looking at your 1100/1200 degree C furnaces and wondered if you could let me know the power requirements?  I'm designing my lab to house 6 furnaces and want to know the current/voltage needed to run them.

Type: application/pdf
Size: 7256829
(2021-02-16 11:04:39) Wishart Group: 230 V 1/N/PE
(2021-02-16 11:06:41) Wishart Group: There are a few options:
LE Series on page 16 of attached (1100C)
L/LT Series on page 17 (1300C)
Whta size do you require?
(2021-02-16 11:07:42) Visitor 48407251: I'm looking at the largest bench top ones I can get.
(2021-02-16 11:08:29) Visitor 48407251: We'll then want to move on to large floor standing ones.  But I'm struggling to find many that can achieve that kind of temperature.  850 would be acceptable for the floor standing ones.
(2021-02-16 11:09:47) Wishart Group: L (drop down door) or LT 15/13 (Lift Up Door) Inner dimensions in mm w d h 230 x 340 x 170.
(2021-02-16 11:10:00) Wishart Group: Would this size be big enough?
(2021-02-16 11:10:48) Visitor 48407251: Which max temperature was that for?  What are your units on those dimensions?
(2021-02-16 11:11:28) Wishart Group: 1300C, dimensions in millimetres.
(2021-02-16 11:13:26) Wishart Group: For larger floor standing units see page 29 of attached. These run on 400 V 3/N/PE.
(2021-02-16 11:14:03) Wishart Group: Did you download the Nabertherm Lab Brochure attachment from 1st message?
(2021-02-16 11:14:15) Visitor 48407251: Yes, looking at it now
(2021-02-16 11:17:21) Wishart Group: On page 15, L (drop down door) or LT 40/12 (Lift Up Door) 40 Litres, 1200C Inner dimensions in mm w d h 320 x 490 x 250.
(2021-02-16 11:18:18) Wishart Group: https://www.wishartgroup.co.uk/temperature_equipment/furnaces/nabertherm_l_40_12
(2021-02-16 11:18:46) Wishart Group: https://www.wishartgroup.co.uk/temperature_equipment/furnaces/nabertherm_lt_40_12
(2021-02-16 11:19:10) Visitor 48407251: That is the bench top one?  Are these ones exhausted or are they just fully contained?  We have no off-gas so it is just a case of heating up steel.
(2021-02-16 11:21:28) Wishart Group: They have an exhaust air outlet in rear. You can get chimney with fan as optional extra.
(2021-02-16 11:22:39) Visitor 48407251: Are the exhausts scrubbed?
(2021-02-16 11:25:02) Wishart Group: No. What do you need scrubber for? Is there oil on the metal?
(2021-02-16 11:26:18) Visitor 48407251: We'd be avoiding oil on the metal.  It is more just around removing any nasties from the steel surface when it gets up to 900 deg C.
(2021-02-16 11:26:43) Visitor 48407251: Benchtop ones should be fine without
(2021-02-16 11:27:04) Wishart Group: What are the nasties?
(2021-02-16 11:28:42) Visitor 48407251: No worries for now, I'll be aiming to use non-coated steels for the trials.
(2021-02-16 11:30:43) Wishart Group: Do you want a quote for 5 x LT40/12? Do you want a Nabertherm representative to call you?
(2021-02-16 11:31:33) Visitor 48407251: Just to confirm, for the bench top furnaces it would be 230 V, for the standing ones 400 V.  Do you know if there is a specific current/ampage requirement?
(2021-02-16 11:34:35) Wishart Group: LT40/12 is a larger furnace, so it is 400 V 3/N/PE 10.1 amps per phase, roughly 32 amp.

(2021-02-16 11:37:56) Wishart Group: Do you have a mobile number to contact you on?
(2021-02-16 11:38:17) Visitor 48407251: 07500772259
(2021-02-16 11:39:18) Wishart Group: Are you happy for me to share your number with UK Manager Geoff Sargeson of Nabertherm?
(2021-02-16 11:39:30) Wishart Group: GDPR and all that.
(2021-02-16 11:39:56) Wishart Group: Name?
(2021-02-16 11:40:40) Visitor 48407251: Actually, go no for now, I will be back in contact later today/tomorrow.  I just want to make sure I've properly got my requirements down.
(2021-02-16 11:40:48) Visitor 48407251: This has all been super useful though.
(2021-02-16 11:41:16) Visitor 48407251: Essentially I just need to know whether all your approx 1100 bench top options also take a 3 phase supply.
(2021-02-16 11:44:26) Wishart Group: From the table, up to 15 Litres (L(T) 3/11,L(T) 5/11, L(T) 9/11, L(T) 15/11) requires single phase. 24 Litre and 40 Litre are 3 phase (L(T) 24/11,L(T) 40/11).
(2021-02-16 11:45:31) Wishart Group: If you need to contact me directly my email is peter@wishartgroup.co.uk, 07703654678.
(2021-02-16 11:45:37) Visitor 48407251: Brilliant, thank you.  This has been really helpful.  I'll get my lab arrangement approved then will likely be back in touch for formal quotes.
(2021-02-16 11:47:56) Wishart Group: I have a broad knowledge of all lab equipment we sell, but for real technical advice I'd have to get Geoff involved. He's not on the hard sell, just makes sure we've getting you the correct equipment. Although, I understand you're probably just at budgeting stage at the moment.
(2021-02-16 11:48:26) Wishart Group: Thanks for chatting with us. Have we resolved your question(s)?
(2021-02-16 11:54:32) Visitor 48407251: Cheers bud!

(2021-02-11 13:43:59) Visitor 75635202: Do you calibrate weights and weigh scales?
(2021-02-11 13:45:55) Wishart Group: Yes, we're accredited to UKAS/ISO17025 to calibrate weighing machines and ISO9001 to calibrate weights. Weights we can do in house, but we have to attend site for the scales. We're based in Northern Ireland, so it might be uneconomical for us if you're in England.
(2021-02-11 13:47:22) Visitor 75635202: We are based in Warrenpoint, Co.Down.  We have pallet scales and a small bench top scales that need calibrated.  We may also need to purchase a 20Kg weight if you do them. Please call 028 417 54531 to discuss
(2021-02-11 13:48:19) Wishart Group: Who will I ask for?
(2021-02-11 13:49:06) Visitor 75635202: Stephen Lennon
(2021-02-11 13:51:26) Wishart Group: Carla will call you now. Your IP address indicated Wiltshire UK, hence the England assumption.

(2021-01-19 10:51:09) Visitor 96013764: they don't seem right comparing with the photo
(2021-01-19 10:51:51) Visitor 96013764: height 450 mm, width 600 mm, depth 450 mm ?

(2021-01-19 10:55:28) Wishart Group: Internal dimensions of height 450 mm, width 600 mm, depth 450 mm are correct.
(2021-01-19 10:56:01) Wishart Group: Nabertherm do not give us pictures of every furnace, so this is probably a photo of the NA series.
(2021-01-19 10:56:41) Visitor 96013764: ok. Where can I find pictures of this furnace?

(2021-01-19 11:03:49) Wishart Group: OK thanks. I'm on to the factory in Germany, should only be a little longer.
(2021-01-19 11:03:58) Visitor 96013764: ok
(2021-01-19 11:06:06) Visitor 96013764: something is not making sense to me: in your website you have: dimensions (HxWxD mm) - 450x600x450
(2021-01-19 11:06:56) Visitor 96013764: but pdf file d is 600 mm and w and h are 450 mm, for the 120/45 model
(2021-01-19 11:07:57) Wishart Group: The elements are on the bottom, right side and top of chamber.
(2021-01-19 11:08:42) Visitor 96013764: thank you
(2021-01-19 11:09:27) Wishart Group: It's probably a typo on the website. I'll correct these. Pictures are from Nabertherm Catalogue, these will be correct.

(2021-01-19 11:11:13) Wishart Group: Yes.
(2021-01-19 11:11:35) Visitor 96013764: Does the left side only have insulation material?
(2021-01-19 11:16:28) Wishart Group: I'd have to check that with the factory.
(2021-01-19 11:16:59) Wishart Group: What exactly do you want to use it for? Do you want an access port?
(2021-01-19 11:17:33) Visitor 96013764: I want to have access through a small hole.
(2021-01-19 11:19:54) Wishart Group: OK. This can probably be added as an optional extra. What size of hole?
(2021-01-19 11:20:45) Visitor 96013764: it is not decided yet, but 5 to 10 mm should be enough

(2020-11-12 11:19:11) Wishart Group: Thanks for chatting with us. Have we resolved your question(s)?
(2020-11-12 11:19:31) Visitor 51377604: No
(2020-11-12 11:21:34) Visitor 51377604: The filter operating alarm is off and the air velocity control is low. Anytime i put it on, what could be the possible cause.
(2020-11-12 11:22:11) Wishart Group: How old is the unit?
(2020-11-12 11:23:17) Visitor 51377604: Close to 3 years.
(2020-11-12 11:23:32) Wishart Group: Have you changed filters?
(2020-11-12 11:24:15) Visitor 51377604: It has been a while since we change the last one we replaced.
(2020-11-12 11:25:54) Wishart Group: Filters are probably saturated. They most likely need changed.
(2020-11-12 11:27:17) Visitor 51377604: Oh ok. I thought as much but i was wondering if possibly there is a fault. Even the sound it makes has changed as it has reduced.
(2020-11-12 11:27:41) Visitor 51377604: how much will the filters cost?
(2020-11-12 11:28:30) Visitor 51377604: can you help me with a quotation so that i can inform my head of department as soon as possible.
(2020-11-12 11:28:41) Wishart Group: Do you know what filters you have?
(2020-11-12 11:29:17) Visitor 51377604: to be honest No
(2020-11-12 11:29:50) Wishart Group: Take filter out and check part number.
(2020-11-12 11:31:53) Visitor 51377604: Alright. You mean the one located in the Fume Cabinet? Because i can see ASTM-001 is that what you are talking about?
(2020-11-12 11:43:33) Wishart Group: ASTM-001 is £170 per unit you'll need 2.
(2020-11-12 11:46:28) Wishart Group: Do you have a UK freight forwarder?
(2020-11-12 11:53:14) Visitor 51377604: No please
(2020-11-12 11:53:55) Wishart Group: OK. I'll email you quote with shipping to Ghana.
(2020-11-12 11:54:33) Visitor 51377604: Alright that would be very helpful.
(2020-11-12 11:54:40) Wishart Group: Do you only want 2 filters? Delivery will be expensive, so you should get multiple units?
(2020-11-12 11:56:42) Visitor 51377604: Yes i agree with you. Purchasing may 10 units will be fine. But wont it expire?
(2020-11-12 11:57:14) Wishart Group: No expiration on filters. I'll quote you for 10 units. Thanks.
(2020-11-12 11:58:35) Visitor 51377604: Please add the unit price per one too. so that i my Head can see.

(2020-10-16 12:28:04) Wishart Group: LR700 is the closest with 618 Litres capacity. LR1400 is next size up, but it's probably too big with capacity of 1361 Litres.

(2020-10-05 14:23:44) Visitor 30486594: I am looking for a balance which weights to 2 decimal places in grams.
(2020-10-05 14:24:14) Wishart Group: What capacity? 2kg, 4kg, 8kg...
(2020-10-05 14:24:36) Visitor 30486594: up to 8kg if possible
(2020-10-05 14:26:32) Wishart Group: https://www.wishartgroup.co.uk/mettler_toledo_-_laboratory_ms12002ts_00?search=%20MS12002TS

(2020-10-05 14:27:17) Wishart Group: Judging from your viewing I think you're thinking of a different budget?

(2020-10-05 14:29:34) Visitor 30486594: Thanks for the options. Price within reason isn't a huge factor. Will look at these 2 scales and have a think.
(2020-10-05 14:30:51) Wishart Group: No problems. The MS is a very robust scale. It's tested to do up to 1 million weighings, that's 100 weighings a day for 30 years.
(2020-10-05 14:31:05) Wishart Group: Do you want a quotation for both options?
(2020-10-05 14:31:24) Visitor 30486594: That would be good. Thanks.
(2020-10-05 14:31:38) Visitor 30486594: Can you send it to kevin.mccrory@almacgroup.com

(2020-09-18 11:08:43) Wishart Group: Air Science UK have 2 HLF-48 in stock. So lead time is 1 week.
(2020-09-18 11:10:04) Visitor 18409858: The list price should be fine for now its just to get an idea on cost difference between fitting a lab with laminar hoods vs biosafety cabinets.
(2020-09-18 11:13:18) Wishart Group: OK No problem. There would be extra discount for multiple units, but you might want to pay for installation and DOP testing. If you need a price in the future please feel free to contact me directly on peter@wishartgroup.co.uk. You should be aware that bio safety cabinets are in high demand for COVID-19 testing. So if you're going down that route, then I'd allow for 2 to 3 months lead time.
(2020-09-18 11:13:46) Visitor 18409858: thank you
(2020-09-18 11:13:50) Wishart Group: Thanks for chatting with us. Have we resolved your question(s)?

I'm looking for an instrument to measure the cocoa bean temperature inside the product (hard consistency).
it would have to be like a hyper dermic needle so that the bean did not shatter.

 

Would you have a solution?


Thanks,
Sara

(2019-10-16 11:11:33) Visitor 81033601: For product ME2002/M sorry!
(2019-10-16 11:12:17) Wishart Group: EX Vat. If you add to basket VAT is added.
(2019-10-16 11:12:53) Wishart Group: Forward slash M models are approved. Do you need an approved model?
(2019-10-16 11:14:10) Visitor 81033601: Approved meaning ISO accredited?
(2019-10-16 11:15:34) Wishart Group: No, approved meaning legal for trade, this is if you're selling of it or doing SQC.
(2019-10-16 11:16:19) Wishart Group: ISO is calibration which you can get after purchasing a balance.
(2019-10-16 11:17:39) Wishart Group: By the sounds of things you do not need an approved balance, non-approved models are less expensive.

(2019-10-15 10:53:42) Visitor 87436248: Can this model be adjusted between the specific temperatures ?
(2019-10-15 10:55:24) Visitor 87436248: Customer is testing batteries so needs to keep adjusting temperatures between the ranges to test at 0/-20 ??
(2019-10-15 10:56:25) Wishart Group: Does he want to manually set the different temperatures or automatically adjust temperatures?
(2019-10-15 10:58:18) Visitor 87436248: Doesnt really mind as long as it can be done one way or another. Obviously if its done via the Controller then would need to show them how the program works to get into the controller to adjust when different temps required.
(2019-10-15 11:01:33) Wishart Group: The temperature of the Arctiko LF 100 can be set at 0.1C increments throughout the range -30 to -10C, so not including 0C.
(2019-10-15 11:02:29) Wishart Group: Each temperature would have to be manually set.
(2019-10-15 11:04:45) Visitor 87436248: Ok sounds good. What is the lead time on this item pls ?
(2019-10-15 11:06:47) Visitor 87436248: Or do you have anything else (small table top) type Freezer which could or would be adjustable between 0/-20 ?
(2019-10-15 11:08:49) Wishart Group: Just checking with Arctiko.
(2019-10-15 11:08:58) Visitor 87436248: thanks
(2019-10-15 11:09:48) Wishart Group: LF 100 is currently sold out. Lead time is 4 weeks.
(2019-10-15 11:10:30) Wishart Group: I looked at the cheaper LFE110, but this does not have adjustable temperature control.
(2019-10-15 11:11:29) Wishart Group: You can set LF 100 to -5C, but stability at these higher temperatures is not as good.
(2019-10-15 11:11:48) Visitor 87436248: So this is the only option then ? Customer is stress testing mobile phone batteries so ideally needs to set different temperatures between 0/-20 for testing.
(2019-10-15 11:12:22) Visitor 87436248: Ok understand
(2019-10-15 11:13:22) Wishart Group: I also asked about the PF100 (the glass door version), but it's not in stock either. LF100 seems like best option I can supply. Do you want an official quote? If so, can I have an email address? Are you reselling?
(2019-10-15 11:15:31) Visitor 87436248: Yes reselling. Please send to my business email.  kevin.raworth@porkka.co.uk
(2019-10-15 11:16:17) Wishart Group: Thanks Kevin. I'll quote with resale discount, delivery to UK address.
(2019-10-15 11:16:34) Visitor 87436248: Excellent. Many thanks

(2019-10-14 15:53:14) Visitor 21842956: It will depends on prices. I will need the temperature from 10 to 30 C. If possible send me all the models with the prices than I can decide better

(2019-10-14 14:55:53) Visitor 91302014: what would be the cost for this calibration, is it per unit or depending from the weight?
(2019-10-14 14:57:30) Wishart Group: It's £17 per weight and £25 postage return via DPD. You need to send it into our workshop.

(2019-10-14 10:34:43) Visitor 62885324: Thats fine, can I have a price please or should I contact someone to get an official quote?

(2019-10-14 10:40:43) Wishart Group: Yes, send to peter@wishartgroup.co.uk. If you just let me know quantities and weights that should be enough information.
(2019-10-14 10:40:57) Visitor 62885324: Ok, will do, thanks for your help.

(2019-10-08 12:41:11) Wishart Group: Nope, stick them on eBay.
(2019-10-08 12:41:28) Visitor 33202052: I would if I knew what goes with what!!!
(2019-10-08 12:41:52) Wishart Group: What make are they?
(2019-10-08 12:43:16) Visitor 33202052: Zeiss and Meiji, plus another
(2019-10-08 12:44:14) Wishart Group: They're decent makes. So should be worth enough to go to the effort of selling them. If you send me pictures of the microscopes I could guide you.
(2019-10-08 12:46:44) Visitor 33202052: Give me a min. Many thanks

(2019-10-08 13:17:20) Wishart Group: Microscope 2 is a Meiji EMZ-5TR:

A camera adapter is sitting beside this:

Then you have Canon camera attached at the top.
(2019-10-08 13:20:30) Visitor 33202052: Great, thanks
(2019-10-08 13:27:16) Wishart Group: Microscope 1 is a Zeiss Axiostar Plus:
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Zeiss-Axiostar-Axiostar-Plus-Microscope-Slider-Compatible/274040147356?hash=item3fce10cd9c:g:RwkAAOSwR31dmHJ9
(2019-10-08 13:28:14) Wishart Group: This is it pictured, but the price is for a part.
(2019-10-08 13:30:59) Wishart Group: In all you've probably got £2K worth of stuff if it's all working. Have you tested them? The biggest concern for someone buying a second hand microscope is if the objectives are scratched. Half the price of a microscope is in the objectives.
(2019-10-08 13:32:26) Wishart Group: If you want we could service and clean these microscopes for you to sell. We do this for the entire NHS in Northern Ireland. Cost is £58 per unit plus £25 return shipping. You'd have to ship them to us.

(2019-10-03 12:28:24) Wishart Group: What capacity and readability?
(2019-10-03 12:29:47) Visitor 84205348: 5kgs and 3 decimal places
(2019-10-03 12:31:00) Wishart Group: Dry environment or wet?
(2019-10-03 12:31:21) Visitor 84205348: Dry.
(2019-10-03 12:32:40) Wishart Group: I know we can definitely do this with an AND scale, but I want to look at all the options. Can you give me an hour and I'll send you a quotation?
(2019-10-03 12:33:43) Wishart Group: By 3 decimal places, please confirm you mean 0.001kg and not 0.001g?
(2019-10-03 12:34:22) Visitor 84205348: Sorry, I mean 0.001g.
(2019-10-03 12:34:30) Visitor 84205348: Is that possible?
(2019-10-03 12:35:28) Wishart Group: 5kg to 0.001g is very accurate. Below is a price of a unit:
30316990	Balance XPR5003S                        	£9,170.00
(2019-10-03 12:36:21) Wishart Group: 5kg x 0.01g is more common or even 1kg x 0.001g.
(2019-10-03 12:36:55) Visitor 84205348: Ok , lets go with 1kg x 0.001 please
(2019-10-03 12:37:24) Wishart Group: OK. Can you give me an email address and I'll email you later?
(2019-10-03 12:38:21) Visitor 84205348: Daniel.hood@rolls-royce.com
(2019-10-03 12:38:49) Wishart Group: Thanks Daniel. I'll email you before the end of today.

(2019-10-02 10:57:46) Visitor 75161412: hello, do you have an agitation unit to fit into an existing water bath?
(2019-10-02 10:58:14) Visitor 75161412: I have a water bath, i just need something to fit into it to stir my samples...
(2019-10-02 10:58:25) Wishart Group: Is it a Nickel-Electro water bath?
(2019-10-02 10:58:35) Visitor 75161412: No it's a Grant water bath
(2019-10-02 10:58:55) Wishart Group: Do you have a model?
(2019-10-02 10:58:59) Visitor 75161412: 30x30cm
(2019-10-02 10:59:07) Visitor 75161412: is the area inside
(2019-10-02 10:59:20) Visitor 75161412: depth of 15cm
(2019-10-02 10:59:26) Visitor 75161412: so it is fairly small #
(2019-10-02 10:59:59) Visitor 75161412: JB Academy GRANT, model JBA12
(2019-10-02 11:00:19) Visitor 75161412: thanks
(2019-10-02 11:00:37) Wishart Group: https://nickel-electro.co.uk/water-baths-stirred/ne4-d-stirred-digital-water-baths/#NE4-D
(2019-10-02 11:01:38) Wishart Group: This has a mounting bracket.
(2019-10-02 11:01:39) Wishart Group: 1. This Mounting Bracket is designed to fit the NE4 series Clifton Thermostirrers for mounting on any number of vessels or tanks.
2. Maximum tank thickness for the Bracket = 30mm.

3. Thumb wheel adjuster secures the Bracket and Thermostirrer to tank.

4. The picture above shows Thermostirrer fastened to Bracket and Tank.
(2019-10-02 11:02:05) Wishart Group: Could this clamp to the side of your bath?
(2019-10-02 11:02:42) Visitor 75161412: I want something to shake the samples, like a tray
(2019-10-02 11:03:07) Visitor 75161412: I've seen those shakers that move side to side on older water baths
(2019-10-02 11:03:20) Wishart Group: You'd need to get a shaking bath then.
(2019-10-02 11:03:55) Visitor 75161412: is there anything that can be fitted, or placed inside? I small tray with a motor?
(2019-10-02 11:04:58) Wishart Group: NE5-10D you're looking at is what I'd recommend. Shaking mechanism couldn't be retrofitted to an existing bath.
(2019-10-02 11:05:38) Visitor 75161412: ok, do you have a cheaper model like this?
(2019-10-02 11:06:13) Visitor 75161412: even a used model?
(2019-10-02 11:06:13) Wishart Group: NE5-10D is the cheapest shaking water bath we supply.
(2019-10-02 11:07:13) Visitor 75161412: do you have a video of NE5-10D in action?
(2019-10-02 11:07:59) Visitor 75161412: also is there any discount you could offer for this product?
(2019-10-02 11:08:32) Wishart Group: I've just check our stock and we don't have used or ex demo shaking water bath. There is plenty on ebay though.
(2019-10-02 11:09:56) Wishart Group: I don't have video of NE5-10D in action. I can ask Nickel-Electro and email you if they have one?
(2019-10-02 11:10:37) Visitor 75161412: ok thanks b.johnston@wlv.ac.uk
(2019-10-02 11:12:00) Wishart Group: OK I'll email you later with quote as well. What is the b in your name?
(2019-10-02 11:15:20) Visitor 75161412: Brian Johnston
(2019-10-02 11:15:37) Visitor 75161412: thank you, if you can do a good discount it would be approved faster...
(2019-10-02 11:17:06) Wishart Group: Thanks Brian. The list price has gone up to £1750 and we've not changed it. So you're getting discount off the old list price. I can't go any lower I'm afraid.
(2019-10-02 11:18:06) Wishart Group: I've just called Nickel-Electro and unfortunately they have no video of the NE5-10D in action. Lead time on this current unit is approximately 4 weeks.
(2019-10-02 11:18:46) Wishart Group: I'll send you a quote and you can take it from there.
(2019-10-02 11:19:30) Visitor 75161412: ok thanks

(2019-07-02 15:26:56) Visitor 89398726: Hi what is the difference between the SD 75 and theSD75Ln
(2019-07-02 15:27:36) Wishart Group: SD75 75 kg 50 g 316 mm x 280 mm 71209918 120
SD200 200 kg 100 g 316 mm x 280 mm 71209919 120
SD75L 75 kg 50 g 520 mm x 400 mm 71210078 165
(2019-07-02 15:27:45) Wishart Group: Pan size
(2019-07-02 15:28:06) Wishart Group: SD75L is larger 520 x 400mm
(2019-07-02 15:28:49) Maarten: Thank you I have one that is showing an E error code
(2019-07-02 15:29:54) Maarten: Do you have a distributor based in Northern Ireland?
(2019-07-02 15:30:26) Wishart Group: Yes, we're based at Ballyclare in Northern Ireland
(2019-07-02 15:31:06) Wishart Group: Do you need an engineer to look at them?
(2019-07-02 15:31:12) Maarten: Do you have stock of theSD 75/L?
(2019-07-02 15:32:06) Maarten: I think mine is over 8 years old and I suspect it might be beyond saving
(2019-07-02 15:33:45) Wishart Group: None in stock at the moment, but Ohaus ship this scale the same day from Amsterdam Hub, so lead time is 1 week.
(2019-07-02 15:34:46) Maarten: Oh dear...how much is the call out fee for a technician to Bangor
(2019-07-02 15:35:57) Wishart Group: £58 per hour. Wouldn't be worth it at the cost of the scale. We have some 60kg scales ex demo scales in stock if you need quick delivery.
(2019-07-02 15:36:42) Maarten: How much are e
(2019-07-02 15:37:07) Maarten: we looking at for a demo  model

Type: image/png
Size: 84264
(2019-07-02 15:40:30) Wishart Group: It would be this sort of scale without the column. 400 mm x 500
mm platform.
(2019-07-02 15:41:24) Maarten: This model wont work for my purposes...ideally i am looking for something like the Sd 75 as I place the scale in some type of cradle with a big plastic container on top of it as I need the scale for weighing laundry
(2019-07-02 15:44:22) Wishart Group: Price is £200, list price was £679. It's also trade approved, which the SD-75 isn't available in. Technically if you're trading by weight you should have trade approved.
(2019-07-02 15:47:39) Maarten: I only use the scale to get the correct loading capacity for industrial sized washing machines ...we hire out linen  by the the unit and not by weight
(2019-07-02 15:50:17) Wishart Group: OK. Well if the SD-75L is the only scale suitable for you then I'd have to order it in. I doubt anyone will have this in stock locally as it's not very common scale.
(2019-07-02 15:53:24) Maarten: Okay thank you I will get back to you...just need to run it by the "minister of finance" right now she is quite grumpy trying to chase up outstanding accounts..Thanks for your help
(2019-07-02 15:53:56) Wishart Group: Will I send you a quote?
(2019-07-02 15:57:15) Maarten: yes please
(2019-07-02 15:57:36) Wishart Group: No problems. I've got you email address here.
(2019-07-02 15:58:14) Maarten: my email address is bangorlinenhire@gmail.com
(2019-07-02 15:58:45) Maarten: or you can use the the other one either one is fine

(2019-07-02 15:25:03) Wishart Group: Yes, I'll just get the information
(2019-07-02 15:25:27) Matt: Thank you

be used in conjunction with the ICS__9 f-Version

(2019-07-02 15:31:13) Matt: Crikey, that's more than i'd have expect for a serial cable.
(2019-07-02 15:31:48) Matt: Ours is ICS425k-6SM/f
(2019-07-02 15:32:42) Wishart Group: Yes, price is correct. I've got some second hand ones if you like?
(2019-07-02 15:33:20) Matt: I just need a cable. If it works and is much cheaper then we're onto a winner.
(2019-07-02 15:34:08) Wishart Group: OK. £50 sound OK?
(2019-07-02 15:34:33) Matt: It sounds like you're wanting to haggle ;)

(2019-06-28 09:17:41) Visitor 69452152: hi
(2019-06-28 09:17:46) Visitor 69452152: I hope you are well.
(2019-06-28 09:18:22) Wishart Group: Hi, how can we help you today? =)
(2019-06-28 09:18:29) Visitor 69452152: I just wanted to ask if i am going to get a free calibration certificate for the infrared thermometers?
(2019-06-28 09:18:49) Wishart Group: Which model?
(2019-06-28 09:19:24) Visitor 69452152: for example 814-075
(2019-06-28 09:19:57) Visitor 69452152: 814-045 as well please
(2019-06-28 09:20:15) Visitor 69452152: 814-040
(2019-06-28 09:22:01) Wishart Group: I've just check with ETI and they do not give calibration certificate FOC with Infrared units. They do with other units.
(2019-06-28 09:22:23) Visitor 69452152: is that because they do not need calibration?
(2019-06-28 09:22:42) Wishart Group: 5 point traceable IR certificate instrument only (-18, 0, +40, +70, +100°C) is £64.00 before our discount
(2019-06-28 09:23:39) Visitor 69452152: which one is it?
(2019-06-28 09:24:12) Wishart Group: Not really. Calibration is more for accreditation. If you or your business was working to a standard, say ISO9001, then you would require it. Otherwise you do not need it.
(2019-06-28 09:24:51) Wishart Group: 5 point traceable IR certificate is for any of the IR models you mentioned.
(2019-06-28 09:24:56) Visitor 69452152: It is one of the BRC requirements so we do need it with the calibration certificate
(2019-06-28 09:25:18) Wishart Group: OK then you'll need it.
(2019-06-28 09:25:53) Visitor 69452152: so it will be price of the thermometer + calibration certificate £64
(2019-06-28 09:27:04) Wishart Group: Price of thermometer + discounted calibration certificate (£64 - 30% = £44.80)
(2019-06-28 09:27:29) Wishart Group: If you want I can send you a quote? Just need an email address.
(2019-06-28 09:31:29) Visitor 69452152: ok. so it will be £44 for each Thermometer including certificate?
(2019-06-28 09:32:05) Visitor 69452152: Iwona@aimlogisticsltd.com
(2019-06-28 09:32:30) Wishart Group: No, only the calibration certificate  is £44.80
(2019-06-28 09:32:35) Visitor 69452152: ooo ok
(2019-06-28 09:33:19) Wishart Group: Is there a particular one of the 3 thermometers you mentioned you want quoted?
(2019-06-28 09:33:45) Visitor 69452152: Please can i get quotes for all 3
(2019-06-28 09:34:15) Wishart Group: OK. I'll send them to you within the next hour.

(2019-05-23 12:11:23) Visitor 71928742: Hi im looking a new lead from our scales to weighing platform.  its 5 pin from the scales to 4 pin at platform.  is this something you could supply?#
(2019-05-23 12:11:55) Wishart Group: What make?
(2019-05-23 12:14:46) Visitor 71928742: i will look at it now give me 2 mins
(2019-05-23 12:15:46) Wishart Group: OK
(2019-05-23 12:18:51) Visitor 71928742: Model : XK3100-B2+
(2019-05-23 12:19:06) Visitor 71928742: it has your sticker on back for calibration.
(2019-05-23 12:19:18) Visitor 71928742: cert no: MA-374
(2019-05-23 12:22:50) Wishart Group: We would have calibrated it, but we didn't sell it. It's a Shanghai Yousheng scale. As it's Chinese, you'll struggle to get the part. I doubt we'd have one in our stock as it's a rare brand.
